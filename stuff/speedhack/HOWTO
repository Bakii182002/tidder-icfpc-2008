Subject: [Icfpc08] Server speed
To: icfpc08@cs.pdx.edu


I've developed a method to make the server run the simulated time
faster to allow for quick running of many tests, and thought that
others might be interested.  This probably only works on Linux.  To
compile the attached code, do:

gcc -fPIC -shared -nostartfiles -m32 speedhack.c -o speedhack.so -ldl

(I'm developing this on a 64-bit machine.  The -m32 is probably not
necessary on a 32-bit machine).

To use it, run the server like so:

LD_PRELOAD=./speedhack.so ./server [normal parameters here]

The speedup can be adjusted by changing FACTOR at the top of the file.

I can't guarantee the results with this hack will be the same as
without it -- I don't know how the server reacts to having less time to
do its calculations in.  But in my quick tests, it seems to produce
very similar results at least.
