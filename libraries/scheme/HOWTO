You can use the "planet" tool to download and unpack PLaneT packages.

For example, if you want to download the evector package:
1. Check how to require it on planet.plt-scheme.org
   In this example: (require (planet "evector.scm" ("soegaard" "evector.plt" 1 1)))
2. Fetch the .plt file, with the information from the last part of the require:
   /..../plt-4.0/bin/planet fetch soegaard evector.plt 1 1
3. Unpack the .plt file:
   /..../plt-4.0/bin/planet open evector.plt .
4. Remove the .plt file
   rm evector.plt
5. Require the main file, it's the first string in the require we saw:
   (require "..../evector.scm")
