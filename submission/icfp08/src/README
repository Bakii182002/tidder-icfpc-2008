Pardon the huge mess, we were still hacking until right before the deadline.

Here's a small guide to what's what, but I wouldn't recommend any sane
person to check out the source...

parser-test.scm -- the main file, the strange name shows how hacky this is
ai.scm          -- the part that does the thinking
control.scm     -- abstracts moving
network.scm     -- quick and dirty network stuff
parser.scm      -- parses the messages we get
intersect.scm   -- line/circle intersection mechanism
tangent.scm     -- compute how we can drive just around the circles
angles.scm      -- various stuff with radians and degrees

The rest is stuff that may or may not be unused at the moment.
Again, pardon the mess!

Control flow: wait for message -> parse -> think -> respond ---\
              ^----------------------------------------------- /

Strategy: race to the target while barely avoiding problems.
